Introduction
====

GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Toolkit) is a C++17
library  to  let   a  user  declare  his  or   her  own  combinatorial
problems. It  implements a meta-heuristic  solver aiming to  solve any
kind of  combinatorial and optimization RTS-related  problems declared
in Constraint Programming.

GHOST  allows  the  user  to  easily  declare  problems  in  different
Constraint  Programming  formalisms  such as  Constraint  Satisfaction
Problems  (CSP),   Constrained  Optimization  Problems   (COP),  Error
Function Satisfaction Problems (EFSP), and Error Function Optimization
Problems (EFOP). 

This toolkit has  first been designed to  solved optimization problems
within the game StarCraft: Brood war, but can be used to deal with any
combinatorial problems. It is a  generalization of the Wall-in project
(see
[github.com/richoux/Wall-in](https://github.com/richoux/Wall-in)).

The         source         code        is         available         at
[github.com/richoux/GHOST](https://github.com/richoux/GHOST),  and the
documentation                         pages                         at
[richoux.github.io/GHOST](http://richoux.github.io/GHOST).   GHOST  is
under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 licence.

Install instructions,  a short Constraint Programming  tutorial, GHOST
tutorials,  and more,  are available  on the  [wiki of  GHOST's GitHub
page](https://github.com/richoux/GHOST/wiki/).
